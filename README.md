# Failed Login Attempt Monitor Notifications

This Python script monitors for failed login attempts on your Linux system using the `lastb` command and sends real-time notifications via Gotify/Email when a new failed login is detected.

## Features

* **Real-time monitoring:** Detects and notifies you of new failed login attempts as they occur.
* **Notifications:**  Sends clear and concise notifications to your Gotify-enabled devices or email.
* **Efficient:** Checks for new failed logins periodically to avoid excessive resource usage.

## Prerequisites

* **Linux system with `lastb`:**  Ensure that the `lastb` command is available on your system (commonly found on Linux distributions).
* **Python 3:**  The script requires Python 3 to be installed.
* **Gotify server and app:** If using Gotify, set up a Gotify server and create an app to obtain the necessary URL and token.
* **Email:** If using email it is recommended to use an app password.
